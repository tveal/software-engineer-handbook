# Updating All the Things!

Given:
  - bash modules with update scripts
    - wallpaper
    - crontab
    - node
    - git
    - (more to come)

Then:
- make sure they all work in batch update
  - account for order of things
  - account for git changes that change the script behaviors

## Revisit Scheduling (crontab)

Recall when we setup [scheduling updates](./018672d1-fbe1-40d7-9fcf-23396c83b628.md),
specifically where we point to the root update script

```bash
local updateAll="$THIS_DIR/../../update.sh >> $logFile 2>&1"
```

This points to `pi-commander/update.sh`

Up to this point (unless you caught it earlier and changed it), we have the
following in the root update script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
THIS_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"
source $THIS_DIR/bash/utils.sh

function main() {
  echo "Starting the Pi Commander Update!"

  update wallpaper
}

function update() {
  $THIS_DIR/bash/$1/update.sh
}

runMain "$@"
```

Problems
- We're only calling the wallpaper update script
- If we simply add the other bash modules (ex. crontab, node, git):
  - we'll run into the similar problem later if we add another module, but
    forget to add it here
  - this script is loaded into memory before execution; if we pull updates that
    change which modules load in this script, they won't apply until the next
    iteration, leading to another can of worms

Resolution
- update git first
  - add a git-clean step after pull to account for orphaned folders/files
    (happens when we rename folders that had ignored files)
- dynamically load the rest of the bash module update scripts _after_ git has
  pulled latest
  - account for order, name of folders in bash

## Add Git Clean Logic

In `bash/git/update.sh`, move `local trunk="main"` _out_ of `pullLatestIfClean`
and _into_ the `main` function; We need to reference this in another function
we'll call from main.

FROM
```bash
function pullLatestIfClean() {
  local trunk="main"
  ...
```

TO
```bash
function main() {
  local trunk="main"
  ...
```

Next, add a new function near the end of `bash/git/update.sh` but before the
`runMain` call

```bash
function cleanGitIfChanged() {
  local cwd="$(pwd)"
  cd "$THIS_DIR/../../"

  local activeBranch="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
  local gitDiff="$(git status --porcelain)"

  if [ -z "$gitDiff" ] && [ "$activeBranch" == "$trunk" ] && hasGitChanges; then
    echo "Cleaning git workspace because changes after pull (git clean -fd)"
    git clean -fd
  fi

  cd "$cwd"
}
```

Takeaways
- We basically want to clean only under the same conditions as pull, with the
  added check for `hasGitChanges`; but this check can't happen until we pull,
  then update the `LAST_COMMIT_FILE`... tricky stuff, but we also don't want to
  force-delete-clean more frequently than we have to

Now, make sure to add the call to this new function, at the end of the `main` function

```bash
function main() {
  local trunk="main"
  setAliases

  test -f "$LAST_COMMIT_FILE" && cp "$LAST_COMMIT_FILE" "$PREV_COMMIT_FILE"

  # don't halt all update scripts if network breaks on git pull
  set +e
  pullLatestIfClean
  set -e

  echo "$(cd $THIS_DIR/../../ && git log --format="%H" -n 1)" > "$LAST_COMMIT_FILE"

  cleanGitIfChanged
}
```

## Root Update Script

Now hop over to the root `pi-commander/update.sh`; replace all it's contents
with the following:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
THIS_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"
source $THIS_DIR/bash/utils.sh

function main() {
  update git

  for path in $( cd "$THIS_DIR" && getUpdateScripts ); do
    local module="$(echo "$path" | cut -d/ -f2)"
    if [ "$module" != "git" ]; then
      update "$module"
    fi
  done
}

function update() {
  "$THIS_DIR/bash/$1/update.sh"
}

function getUpdateScripts() {
  find bash -mindepth 2 -maxdepth 2 -name 'update.sh' | sort
}

runMain "$@"
```

Takeaways
- update git first
- dynamically find all `update.sh` files specifically 2 levels down from root,
  in the bash folder (so `bash/<module>/update.sh`)
  - update in order of module name

## Bash Module Names

Currently, if you were to run the root update script, it would execute the
`update.sh` files for the following, in this order:
1. git
2. crontab
3. node
4. wallpaper

This isn't necessarily a problem, as long as git is first; However, I prefer the
following order:
1. git
2. wallpaper
3. crontab
4. node

This way, I set the wallpaper as close to the 0th and 5th minutes (scheduled
update cycles), and the lengthier modules are near the end of the update chain.

To achieve this, rename the folders accordingly (leave git as-is)
- 01-wallpaper
- 02-crontab
- 03-node

Later, we'll add 04-deploy, but we have to build the server/app before that.

[Updating All the Things complete!](https://github.com/tveal/template-pi-commander/compare/v0.6-git...v0.7-update-all-things)
If you've been running this code so far on a Raspberry Pi, you might need to
manually run a `git clean -fd` or wait for future cycles to clear it up, as this
change won't fully apply the first round, since the fix wasn't "in memory" when
executed upon pulling these changes.

Automation is cool, but accounting for idempotency needs and propagation can
introduce some very nasty complexities.
