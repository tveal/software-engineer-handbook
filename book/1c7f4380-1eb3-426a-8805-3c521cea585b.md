# Git Aliases and Init

## Aliases

Any new git setup I come across, I quickly set aliases for the most fundamental
(and frequent) git commands:

```bash
git config --global alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.br branch
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.st status
```

**Git User**

- **Global** - To commit changes to a repo, you will need to configure your
  author; You can do this at a global level with:

    ```bash
    git config --global user.email "your.git.user.email@host.com"
    git config --global user.name "your-git-username"
    ```

- **Local** - But if you operate with different git users, depending on repo,
  then omit the `--global` flag, and run per repo

    ```bash
    git config user.email "your.git.user.email@host.com"
    git config user.name "your-git-username"
    ```

- **Alias** - Even better, make it an alias! Wherever your bash profile config
  is, such as `~/.bashrc`, add an alias to the file, like so:

    ```bash
    alias iamgit='git config user.email "your.git.user.email@host.com"; git config user.name "your-git-username"'
    ```
    You'll need to reload your terminal to get the new alias in-session

## Create a New Repo

Multiple Options (to list a few)
1. Locally: From command-line
2. Remote: Git repository server, typically via GUI
3. Hybrid: From command-line, then on server, and merge the two

The optimal option depends on your case and/or preference. Try them all out -
add to your toolbox; You never know when you might need to do things
differently.

### [1] From Command Line

1. Make a new directory for your repo

    ```bash
    mkdir my-cool-new-repo
    ```

2. Initialize a git repo

    ```bash
    cd my-cool-new-repo
    git init
    ```

3. Add initial commit

    ```bash
    echo "# my-cool-new-repo" > README.md
    git add README.md
    git commit -m 'initial commit'
    ```

### [2] From Git Repository Server

1. Follow the procedure for your chosen git server in creating a repo
2. Clone your new repo from the url provided by your server

    ```bash
    git clone <clone-url>
    ```
    This will clone your repo into a new directory (with name of the repo you
    created on the server). Run `ls -l` to see the files/folders in your current
    directory

### [3] Create locally, then migrate to remote

There's many ways this can be done. I'll outline a workflow and leave the rest
up to you to explore. The gist:
- Create a repo locally, do things, commit code, etc.
- When you want to publish to a remote server, create a remote repo of same
  name, but don't add initial files/commit
- Take the clone url of the new remote repo, and add it as a remote to your
  local repo and push

**Checking/Adding remote url to local git repo**

List existing remote url's
```bash
git remote -v
```

Add new remote
```bash
git remote add origin <clone-url>
```
